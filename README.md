# Placement-prediction-system-using-ML-algos
To propose an innovation in recruitment system based on the usage of various networking websites like Linkedin, Twitter, version control systems like GitHub and competitive coding platforms. It is aimed to develop an automation in placement prediction at college level which predicts the chances of undergraduate students getting placed in an IT company and helps in profiling a candidate before the recruitment process starts. It involves the use of machine learning model of k-nearest neighbor algorithm as base model to classify students or users into appropriate clusters and the result would help them in improving their skills and other mindset. The results of the same is also compared with the results obtained from other models like logistic regression, random forest and SVM for optimal solution. With various data mining and machine learning techniques, this proposition would help both students as well as recruiters during placements and other recruitment activities.
